    <h3>Hello!</h3>
    Today is my first day of learning javascript.
    <ul>
        <li>let is used to make variables. It is of dynamic type. It can be number,boolean,string,etc.It can't be redeclared.</li>
        <li>var is used to make a global variable.</li>
        <li>const is used to make fixed values.Must be assigned a value when declared.</li>
        <li>In javascript dynamic typing is there. We can change the data-type of variable.</li>
        <li>Objects are collection of key-value pairs.</li>
        <li>Arrays is a collection of data. In javascript elements of array can be of different data-types.</li>
        <li>== if data is same or not, === if data as well as data-type are same or not</li>
   
    </ul>
